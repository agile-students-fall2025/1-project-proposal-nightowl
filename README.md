# Over Budget
## What and why?
We want to build a budgeting software for projects. It is always hard to keep track of budgets and expenses when working with a large group of people, especially when everyone needs to spend money for their own department. This software allows you to co-edit a budget list with everyone in your team to organize everything into a single master list.
For example, as a film and TV student, I constantly see my producers suffering with keeping track of money and resulting in going over the budget we have. This software will help them be more organized and raise awareness throughout the entire team on how much money we are spending and how much money we have left. 

## For whom?
People who organize events/that have a shared budget across branches.
E.g. film producers

## How?
Users would have a login system to verify user identity. The user can put in the amount of money spent and anything else with it. And the software will recommend the amount of money you should spend on each department.

## Scope
It's not too easy because it wonâ€™t be an app that replaces Excel sheets. It includes features such as, users can set the expected percentage of the amount of money they want to spend on each department and the software will remind each department head how much more money they can spend. It also includes the co-editing mode that allows the entire team to have access and visibility to it.
It is not too ambitious since JavaScript handles user requests and Python/Java handle user authentication backend and data synchronization.
